This is an [Express.js](https://expressjs.com) and [React](https://react.dev) project bootstrapped with [Vite](https://vite.dev).

## Getting Started

First, run the Express server:

```bash
cd server
npm run dev
```

Next, run the React client:
```bash
cd ../client
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) with your browser to view the client.

You can also open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) with your browser to view server events.

You can start editing the client page by modifying `/client/src/App.sjx`.
